I always wondered why folks are always so concerned about the exact weather conditions outside.  Sixty-nine degrees in this city, 68 in this other one, etc.  Heck, all I want to know is, is it hot, cold, or comfortable?  Is it raining, snowing, or sunny?  How hard is the wind blowing?

This program is an analog clock that runs on your desktop, written in Java.  It will fetch the current weather conditions for the region you select and modify itself accordingly.  You can tell at a glance what the conditions are outside, in an intuitive and approximate manner.  Oh yes, it's also an analog clock.  See the help window for more information.

There are other features that I would like to add to this clock, such as sunrise/sunset, forecast, etc.  But I want to keep the GUI quick, easy to understand, and intuitive.  Other items on the wishlist:

> - Have the square window frame appear only when the mouse is over the clock.

> - Improve the looks by adding shadows, highlights, etc. to make it more realistic.
